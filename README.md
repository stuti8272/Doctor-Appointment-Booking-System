# Doctor-Appointment-Booking-System
I had  develop a comprehensive full-stack web application utilizing the MERN stack, complemented by Redux for efficient state management.
This undertaking featured a range of key features designed to enhance the user experience and data security. 
Notably, we implemented a robust user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to safeguard user data. 
Additionally, we created an intuitive admin control panel to streamline management processes, along with a doctor profile management system.
Users were also provided with the capability to schedule appointments seamlessly through our application. 
To further elevate the user experience, we integrated a user notification system.
Collectively, these components formed an integrated, user-friendly web application that not only delivered exceptional functionality
but also prioritized data security and accessibility.
